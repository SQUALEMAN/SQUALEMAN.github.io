        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">

          <p class="indented">Hi! I appreciate you taking the time to check out my personal website. Chances are, if you 
            are reading this, you are a prospective employer or a close friend/family member.
            In this section of my website, I'm going to tell you all about me. I enjoy travelling, exercise, sports, music, reading, and 
            crazy foods (especially the food part). Mom is a chef, so I grew up trying a bunch of really cool food. Anyway, pretty 
            normal stuff for a person to be interested in I would say. For sports, I'm really big into football and I'm a big Philadelphia Eagles fan (Go Birds). 
            As far as reading goes, I moreso enjoy reading non-fiction books. I recently finished reading Jordan Peterson's <i>12 Rules For Life</i>, 
            which was a great read. One fun fact about me is that I live with 3 parrots; I have a Caique, Amazon, and a Meyer's. </p>

          <p class="indented">I attended Paul VI High School in Haddonfield, NJ. While in high school, I was a part of the robotics
            team. I competed in First Robotics competitions where we had to do a bunch of cool things with these robots. We had to
            build towers, extract valuable cargo, and battle other bots (not the goal of the competition but it was fun to do). I was
            also on the football team; I had been playing football since I was 5 years olds. I took a couple of coding classes in high
            school: one in Java and one in Python. This is what sparked my interest in computer science. </p>

          <p class="indented"> I then went on to Virginia Tech where I am currently study Computer Science with a concentration in 
            Secure Computing. Most classes I take here are Java and C based. I also took a couple classes that used python, and
            one other class that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From Fall 2022 - Spring 2023, I served as the President of my 
            fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi. During my tenure, I had the oppurtunity to go to a sponsored leadership conference in New Orleans. At this
            conference, my chapter was awarded the Grand Senior President's Cup. This award is given to the #1 chapter for all aspects of the 
            organization and is the most prestigious award an individual chapter can receive. Shared vision, philanthropy, academics, finances, 
            recruitment, and a couple other factors are taken into account to receive this award. I am also currently an Ambassador for the Virginia 
            Tech Department of Computer Science. I am also hoping to become a Teaching Assistant this semester (more to come on that).</p>

          <p class="indented"> Upon my graduation, I hope to work in the fields of software engineering, web development, or data analytics. With
            2 internships worth of professional experience, I am still figuring out exactly which specific field I want dive the deepest into.
            Some current interests of mine are artificial intelligence, web development, and data analytics. These are areas
            that I am currently researching and trying to gain a better understanding of. I'd like to be a jack of all trades; and aim to be a
            master of them as well.
