        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">

          <p class="indented">I appreciate you taking the time to view my personal webpage. I have my Github and LinkedIn Profiles linked in the above section.
            If you are a prospective employer looking to view my code, please contact me using the information at the bottom of this webpage; my project repositories 
            are private in accordance with the Virginia Tech Honor Code.</p>
            
          <p class="indented">
            In this section of my webpage, I'm going to tell you all about me. I enjoy travelling, exercise, sports, music, reading, and 
            trying new foods. I'm very interested in football and I'm a big Philadelphia Eagles fan (Go Birds). 
            I enjoy reading non-fiction books. I recently finished reading Jordan Peterson's <i>12 Rules For Life</i>. I enjoy all 
            types of music and food and pride myself on having very diverse palette for them.
            A fun fact about me is that I live with 3 parrots; I have a Caique, Amazon, and a Meyer's. </p>
          
          <p class="indented">I attended Paul VI High School in Haddonfield, NJ. While in high school, I was a member of the robotics
            team. I competed in <i>First Robotics</i> competitions where I had the opportunity to program many fascinating maneuvers with these robots. We implemented
            functionality that would build towers, extract valuable cargo, and battle other bots (not the goal of the competition but it was fun to do). I
            also played on the football team for all 4 years; I had been playing football since I was 5 years olds. I took 2 programming classes in high
            school: 1 in Java and 1 in Python. This is what sparked my interest in computer science. </p>

          <p class="indented"> I then went on to Virginia Tech, where I am studying Computer Science with a concentration in 
            Secure Computing. Most classes I am enrolled in are Java and C centric. I also took 2 classes that used Python, and
            1 other class that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From Fall 2022 - Spring 2023, I served as the President of my 
            fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi. During my tenure, I had the oppurtunity to go to a sponsored leadership conference in New Orleans. At this
            conference, my chapter was awarded the Grand Senior President's Cup. This award is given to the #1 chapter for all aspects of the 
            organization and is the most prestigious award an individual chapter can receive. Shared vision, philanthropy, academics, finances, and 
            recruitment are taken into account to receive this award. I am an Ambassador for the Virginia 
            Tech Department of Computer Science, where I help acclimate new students and families to the program. 
            I am also hoping to become a Teaching Assistant this upcoming semester (more to come on that).</p>
            
          <p class="indented"> I interned twice at Lockheed Martin as a Software Engineer Intern. I was responsible for maintaining 
            and developing software solutions for OASIS, a simulation program used by the United States Navy to 
            expedite/improve testing and training for the Aegis Combat System. I worked on this product during both of my internships, on
            two different teams, delving into different components as the project progressed. </p>
            

          <p class="indented"> Upon my graduation, I want to explore the fields of software engineering, web development, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. 
            These are areas that I am currently researching and trying to gain a better understanding of. I'd like to be a jack of all trades; and aim to be a
            master of them as well.</p>
